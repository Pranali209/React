### To start with the project
1. create the file  by name .env in the source of the react app folder
2. create a config.js file and import all the en variables by using (import.meta.env)
3. creating a service - we craete a services bcoz to make ur site independent of the backend , which means
                        now we are using appwrite as a backendservice but maybe going further we want to use 
                        something else  so  we just have to change the service file without changing anything
                1. Creating a folder by name by the name of the backend service (folder name can be anything)
                2. Inside it create a file follow the docs of the backend service which ur using to understand more
